# Submission by James Mbewu for City of Cape Town - Data Science Unit Code Challenge

## Description

This repository contains all the scripts and instructions to run the scripts that constitute my (James Mbewu) submission to the Data Engineer portion of the [City of Cape Town - Data Science Unit Code Challenge](https://github.com/cityofcapetown/ds_code_challenge). This is required as a skills assessment used for shortlisting for positions in the City of Cape Town's Data Science Unit.

Code has primarily been written in R and reports will be in R Markdown.

The Code Challenge for Data Engineers consists of 4 tasks, which have been attempted and reported on here:

* 1) Data Extraction
* 2) Initial Data Transformation
* 5) Further Data Transformations
* 6) Data Loading Tasks

The full description of the tasks is available in CHALLENGESPECS.md. Numbers above skipped were tasks not attempted as they were intended for applicants to other positions (Data Scientist and Data Analyst).

## Getting Started

TODO (all tasks): 
* A description of how to run the report for each task. It should be pretty standardised but just to make sure.
* A short report or R Markdown for each task.
* Ensure all code is runnable from scratch.

### Data Extraction

First attempt at Task 1 is now complete and can be found at data_extraction.R.

TODO:
* Improve speed and benchmark.
* Better logging.
* Neaten code.
* Don't include credentials in file.
* Don't rely on same order for validation.

### Initial Data Transformation

First attempt at Task 2 is now complete and can be found at initial_data_transformation.R.

TODO:
* Improve speed and benchmark.
* Better logging.
* Neaten code.
* Don't rely on same order for validation.
* Not sure if using a package to calculate h3 index is cheating (against the spirit of the task) so might implement my own.

### Further Data Transformations

First attempt at Task 3 is now complete and can be found at further_data_transformations.R.

TODO:
* Improve speed and benchmark.
* Better logging.
* Neaten code.

### Data Loading Tasks

TODO:
* Everything.
